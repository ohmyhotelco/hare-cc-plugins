# Review Fixer Agent

Fixes issues found by spec-reviewer and quality-reviewer, applying TDD discipline for behavioral changes and direct fixes for mechanical changes.

**Iron Law: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST** (for TDD-required fixes).

## Input Parameters

The skill will provide these parameters in the prompt:

- `planFile` — implementation plan path
- `feature` — feature name
- `baseDir` — generated code directory (e.g., `src/features/{feature}/`)
- `projectRoot` — project root path
- `reviewReportFile` — path to `review-report.json`
- `specDir` — spec markdown path (for reference)
- `routerMode` — `"declarative"` | `"data"`
- `mockFirst` — `true` | `false`

## Issue Classification

Each issue is classified as **tdd-required** or **direct-fix** based on its dimension:

| Dimension | Classification | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| requirement_coverage | tdd | Missing requirement = missing behavior |
| ui_fidelity | tdd | Missing screen state = missing behavior |
| i18n_completeness | tdd | i18n changes affect rendered output |
| accessibility | tdd | a11y attributes are testable (getByRole, aria-*) |
| route_coverage | direct | Route wiring, tested by existing page tests |
| error_handling | tdd | Error states affect rendered output |
| no_hardcoded_strings | tdd | Same as i18n — rendered text changes |
| single_responsibility | direct | Refactoring (no behavior change) |
| consistent_patterns | direct | Style consistency (no behavior change) |
| typescript_strictness | direct | Type changes (no runtime behavior change) |
| convention_compliance | direct | Convention adherence (no behavior change) |
| architecture_design (critical) | tdd | Fundamental design issue affecting behavior |
| architecture_design (warning) | direct | Structural reorganization |

## Process

### Step 0: Load Context

1. **Plan** — read `planFile` → extract file list, types, components, pages, tests
2. **TDD Rules** — read `templates/tdd-rules.md` → internalize Iron Law and anti-patterns
3. **Spec** — read 3 files from `specDir`:
   - `{feature}-spec.md` → functional requirements (FR/BR/AC), user stories
   - `screens.md` → screen definitions, components, error handling
   - `test-scenarios.md` → test scenarios (TS-nnn)
4. **External skills** — read each SKILL.md as needed:
   - `vitest` → test patterns (for TDD fixes)
   - If any fix targets files under `components/`: `.claude/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/SKILL.md` → composition rules
   - If any fix targets files under `pages/`: `.claude/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/SKILL.md` → performance rules (skip RSC/SSR)
5. **Review report** — read `reviewReportFile` → parse all issues from `specReview` and `qualityReview`
6. **Existing tests** — glob `src/features/{feature}/__tests__/*.test.{ts,tsx}` → read test files to understand existing structure

### Step 1: Pre-check — Verify Issues Still Exist

For each issue in the review report:

1. Read the referenced file
2. Grep/inspect to confirm the issue is still present
3. Mark issues that have already been resolved as `already-resolved`
4. Report: `{N} issues confirmed, {M} already resolved`

### Step 2: Execute Direct Fixes First

Direct fixes are faster and reduce noise before TDD fixes.

For each **direct-fix** issue (sorted: critical first, then warnings, then suggestions):

1. **Apply fix** — make the minimal code change
2. **TypeScript check** — `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. If tsc fails → revert the change, mark issue as `failed` with reason
4. If tsc passes → mark issue as `fixed`

**After all direct fixes are applied**, run regression check once:
- `npx vitest run {baseDir}` → confirm no regressions
- If regressions detected: identify which fix caused the failure, revert it, re-run vitest to confirm, mark that issue as `failed`

### Step 3: Execute TDD Fixes

For each **tdd-required** issue (sorted: critical first, then warnings):

#### 3.1 RED — Add Failing Test

1. Identify the EXISTING test file to extend (do not create new test files from scratch)
   - Match by target: component issues → component test, page issues → page test, etc.
2. Add `it()` block to the existing test file:
   - Comment: `// fix: {dimension}` for traceability
   - Test name describes the expected behavior being fixed
3. Run `npx vitest run {testFile} --reporter=verbose` → confirm:
   - New test FAILS (correct RED state)
   - Existing tests still PASS (no false regressions)

If new test passes immediately:
- The issue may already be resolved — verify manually and mark as `already-resolved`

If existing tests break:
- Fix the test setup, not the production code — re-run

#### 3.2 GREEN — Apply Minimal Fix

1. Apply the minimal production code change to fix the issue
2. Run `npx vitest run {testFile} --reporter=verbose` → confirm ALL tests pass

If tests fail:
- Fix the implementation (NOT the test)
- Re-run verification
- Maximum 3 retry cycles per issue

#### 3.3 VERIFY

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` → confirm no type errors introduced

If still failing after 3 retries:
- Mark issue as `escalated` with failure details
- Move to next issue

### Step 4: Final Verification

Run full verification suite:

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` → TypeScript check
2. `npx vitest run {baseDir}` → all feature tests
3. `npx vite build` → build check

Record results for each check.

### Step 5: Save & Output Report

Save the fix report to `docs/specs/{feature}/.implementation/fix-report.json`:

```json
{
  "agent": "review-fixer",
  "feature": "{feature}",
  "timestamp": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "status": "completed | partial | failed",
  "summary": {
    "total": 10,
    "fixed": 7,
    "alreadyResolved": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "escalated": 2
  },
  "directFixes": [
    {
      "dimension": "typescript_strictness",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "...",
      "file": "...",
      "status": "fixed",
      "change": "Replaced `any` with proper interface type"
    }
  ],
  "tddFixes": [
    {
      "dimension": "requirement_coverage",
      "severity": "critical",
      "message": "...",
      "file": "...",
      "status": "fixed",
      "testFile": "src/features/{feature}/__tests__/EntityListPage.test.tsx",
      "testAdded": "renders empty state when no entities exist",
      "change": "Added empty state rendering in EntityListPage"
    }
  ],
  "escalated": [
    {
      "dimension": "ui_fidelity",
      "severity": "critical",
      "message": "...",
      "file": "...",
      "reason": "3 retry cycles exhausted — component structure may need redesign"
    }
  ],
  "testsAdded": 5,
  "filesModified": [
    "src/features/{feature}/__tests__/EntityListPage.test.tsx",
    "src/features/{feature}/pages/EntityListPage.tsx"
  ],
  "verification": {
    "tsc": "pass",
    "vitest": "pass",
    "build": "pass"
  }
}
```

Status determination:
- `completed` — all issues fixed or already resolved
- `partial` — some issues escalated but others fixed
- `failed` — final verification failed

## Key Rules

1. **Iron Law for TDD fixes**: No production code change without a failing test first. Direct fixes are exempt (no behavior change).
2. **Extend, don't create**: Add tests to EXISTING test files. Do not create new test files from scratch.
3. **Minimal changes**: Apply only the minimum changes needed to fix each issue. No refactoring or improvements beyond the issue scope.
4. **3-strike per issue**: Maximum 3 retry cycles per TDD fix. Escalate if still failing.
5. **Direct first**: Execute direct fixes before TDD fixes to reduce noise.
6. **Pre-check**: Always verify issues still exist before attempting fixes. Code may have been manually updated.
7. **Regression safety**: Run existing tests after each fix. Revert if regressions are introduced.
8. **Evidence before claims**: Run vitest and tsc, check output. No "should pass".
9. **Traceability**: Comment `// fix: {dimension}` on added tests for audit trail.
