# Review Fixer Agent

Fixes issues found by seo-reviewer and quality-reviewer. All fixes are direct (no TDD classification) since homepage sections are primarily presentational.

## Input Parameters

The skill will provide these parameters in the prompt:

- `pageName` — page identifier
- `planFile` — path to `page-plan.json`
- `projectRoot` — project root path
- `reviewReportFile` — path to `review-report.json`
- `config` — homepage-plugin configuration object

## Process

### Phase 0: Load Context

1. **Review report** — read `reviewReportFile` to get all issues with severity, file, line, fixHint
2. **Page plan** — read `planFile` for page structure context
3. **SEO checklist** — read `templates/seo-checklist.md` for reference
4. **Astro conventions** — read `templates/astro-conventions.md` for convention reference

### Phase 1: Pre-Check

For each issue in the review report:

1. **Verify issue still exists** — read the cited file and line to confirm the issue is still present
2. **Remove resolved issues** — if the issue was already fixed (by a previous fix round or manual edit), skip it
3. **Sort by priority** — fix critical issues first, then warnings, then info

### Phase 2: Apply Fixes

Process issues in priority order:

#### SEO Fixes
- **Missing metadata** — add `<title>`, `<meta>` tags to layout or page frontmatter
- **Missing structured data** — add JSON-LD script using `lib/structured-data.ts` generators
- **Heading hierarchy** — restructure headings to proper nesting
- **Image optimization** — add missing `alt`, `width`, `height`, swap `<img>` for `<Image />`
- **Sitemap/robots** — configure `@astrojs/sitemap`, create/update `robots.txt`
- **Performance** — change `client:load` to `client:visible` or `client:idle` where appropriate

#### Quality Fixes
- **Accessibility** — add `aria-label`, fix contrast, add focus indicators, add skip-to-content
- **Responsive** — fix overflow issues, adjust grid breakpoints, increase touch targets
- **Composition** — extract shared logic, fix boolean prop anti-patterns
- **TypeScript** — replace `any` with proper types, add missing interfaces
- **i18n** — replace hardcoded strings with translation keys, add missing keys to locale files
- **Astro conventions** — convert unnecessary React to .astro, fix `client:` directives

### Phase 3: Verification

After all fixes are applied:

1. **TypeScript check** — `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. **ESLint check** — `npx eslint .` (if config exists)
3. **Build check** — `npx astro build`
4. Report verification results

### Phase 4: Output

Produce a fix report:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-23T...",
  "round": 1,
  "issuesReceived": 5,
  "issuesFixed": 4,
  "issuesSkipped": 1,
  "skippedReasons": [
    {
      "issue": "...",
      "reason": "Issue no longer present in current code"
    }
  ],
  "verification": {
    "tsc": "pass",
    "eslint": "pass",
    "build": "pass"
  },
  "remainingIssues": []
}
```

## Rules

- **Direct fixes only** — no TDD classification (homepage sections are presentational)
- **Minimal changes** — fix only what the review flagged, do not refactor surrounding code
- **Preserve existing functionality** — never break working sections while fixing issues
- **3-strike rule** — maximum 3 retry rounds per issue. If an issue cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, mark it for escalation
- **Verification mandatory** — run tsc + build after each fix batch. Do not claim fixes without verification
- **Evidence before claims** — cite verification output when reporting results

## Escalation

When an issue cannot be fixed after 3 rounds:

1. Mark the issue as `escalated` in the fix report
2. Include:
   - The original issue description
   - What was attempted
   - Why it failed
   - Recommended manual resolution approach
3. The skill will set the page status to `escalated` for manual intervention
